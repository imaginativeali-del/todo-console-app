# Phase 3: AI Integration for Todo Application

## Overview
This phase introduces artificial intelligence into the Todo application
to allow users to manage tasks using natural language commands.

## Objective
The goal is to enable users to interact with the Todo system in a more
human-friendly way instead of using menus or buttons.

## Example Commands
- "Add a task to buy groceries"
- "Show all my tasks"
- "Mark task 2 as completed"
- "Delete task 1"

## AI Workflow
1. User enters a natural language command
2. AI model analyzes the text
3. User intent is identified (add, view, complete, delete)
4. Relevant task information is extracted
5. Backend logic or API is executed
6. Result is returned to the user

## Planned Technologies
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- Prompt-based intent detection
- Backend API integration

## Status
Phase 3 is designed and documented.
Full AI implementation can be completed using an LLM API.
